## What is TxSense?


Sui transactions often come with long hex strings, cryptic digests, object references, Move calls, gas details, and more. TxSense makes it simple:


- Input a **transaction digest** (e.g., from Sui Explorer)
- Or paste a **full transaction link**
- Or raw **transaction hex** (if supported)
- Instantly get a plain-English summary: who sent what, to whom, smart contract calls, coin transfers, events emitted, gas used, success/failure, and more — no deep blockchain knowledge required.


Perfect for:
- DeFi users tracking transfers and swaps
- Developers debugging Move modules and PTBs (Programmable Transaction Blocks)
- Newcomers exploring Sui without getting lost in explorers


## Features


- **Simple interface** — just paste and go
- **Clear summaries** — avoids raw BCS/hex jargon
- **Random transaction button** — "Roll the dice" 🎲 to explore real Sui txns
- **Fast & lightweight** — hosted on Netlify
- Built for the high-speed, parallel-execution world of Sui
